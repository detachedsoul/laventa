# Laventa Ecommerce Website

This is an eCommerce website built with Nextjs and Tailwindcss. I am using [Strapi](https://strapi.io) to manage content, [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) for state management. I am also using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) API to handle the payments.

The live demo can be found on [https://laventa.vercel.app/](https://laventa.vercel.app/). To make payments, you can use the test card number `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any future expiry date and CVC.

Suggestions and contributions are welcome ðŸ–¤.
