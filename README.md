# Laventa Ecommerce Website

 This is my attempt to build an eCommerce website with Nextjs and Tailwindcss. I am using the [Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/) API to fetch the products and the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) API to handle the payments.

The live demo can be found on [https://laventa.vercel.app/](https://laventa.vercel.app/). It's still a work in progress ðŸ–¤.
